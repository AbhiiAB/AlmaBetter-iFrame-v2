While Angular.js offered comprehensive functionalities, it proved challenging for developers due to its extensive coding requirements. React.js, on the other hand, revolutionized web application development by providing a simpler approach. Although React.js is not an MVC framework like Angular.js, it excels as a library. It offers a clean and intuitive code structure, making it easier for developers to understand and work with components. This paper aims to showcase the suitability of React.js frameworks for developing web and mobile applications, highlighting its advantages over other frameworks.</p><h3 id="6d11b6af-a3e2-45f0-898c-68b8c57bbf60" class="">Related Work</h3><p id="05a0b0ce-b008-4b4b-9b04-322206faccd4" class="">Axios has gained significant popularity as an HTTP client for both browsers and Node.js due to its simplicity, lightweight nature, and customization capabilities. It seamlessly integrates with React and various other frameworks, making it an excellent choice for handling requests and responses. Axios offers essential features such as request and response interceptors, data transformers, and automatic JSON conversion. Additionally, it provides built-in protection against cross-site request forgery. This paper explores the practical applications of Axios in React projects, showcasing its capabilities in making async requests, implementing error handling, and performing common HTTP operations like GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE.</p><h3 id="867533bb-da01-441d-af9d-a173b86a1b04" class="">Analysis Methodology</h3><p id="173371f3-087e-41ac-82bb-d4dc9d224fb9" class=""><strong>Analyzed framework</strong> - Comparison would be made of the two most common JavaScript front end Frameworks, and dominance of react.js continues to rise over the years.</p><ul id="2f172ae4-db96-4bdd-b3b7-620fe71fc5c7" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>React VS Angular</strong><ul id="ec65c826-bc7b-4297-90d7-1f9cc69438b2" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:circle">React.js is a library, while Angular is a complete framework.</li></ul><ul id="b05d9829-fb66-4cd7-9b41-7cb3b679042d" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:circle">React.js is easier to learn with fewer topics, while Angular requires more effort to learn.</li></ul><ul id="323e7350-f25d-4d25-aa6c-d87069f1e2ac" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:circle">React.js has server-side rendering advantages, while Angular can be more challenging in server connections.</li></ul><ul id="278c86d6-e749-4a13-96df-6c3522bf33e0" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:circle">React.js uses a lightweight Virtual DOM, making it smaller in size compared to Angular&#x27;s Real DOM.</li></ul><ul id="6fdae112-234e-45be-98ec-dbb77f9d7f97" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:circle">React.js has higher popularity and more downloads.</li></ul><ul id="9d7af0a4-7330-4c69-963b-f3921d0a62b3" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:circle">React.js generally has better SEO and two-way data binding.</li></ul><ul id="9f06c45f-241d-4b96-a632-97cc7ff476e6" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:circle">React.js uses JavaScript, while Angular uses TypeScript.</li></ul><ul id="6b89dcc3-4b77-4486-9cfb-4367a35871c6" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:circle">React.js often provides better mobile solutions compared to Angular.</li></ul></li></ul><ul id="e6538c9a-68d5-46ee-9b41-0e605a476bad" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>React Advantages and Disadvantages</strong><p id="cd318206-08e9-43ee-a9c4-b38092dca2c5" class="">Advantages of choosing React.js for front-end development:</p><ul id="f2970863-c4b1-4734-9c85-da9d371e2ff6" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:circle">Easy to learn and allows for quick development.</li></ul><ul id="1d621f6f-a00e-4bd9-89c5-ac78daea7bd3" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:circle">Helps build a visually appealing and rich interface.</li></ul><ul id="6c304d8c-17d8-4535-bf38-d389da866ee5" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:circle">Faster development process, leading to quicker monetization.</li></ul><ul id="a454e3d7-3c6f-421d-a423-6684bdb9c2b1" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:circle">Trusted by major companies like Netflix.</li></ul><ul id="3a421984-b6df-4f6f-a86f-77c8f34eb1a4" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:circle">Strong community support with a high number of downloads.</li></ul><ul id="ebb250c9-bdda-4acd-a717-9a2d4387a663" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:circle">Trending topic with a lot of interest and development activity.</li></ul><p id="093893fc-cb93-41ec-b40e-33df2ec6d40e" class="">Disadvantages of React.js:</p><ul id="88779b2b-05ed-4649-9081-edf1545f193c" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:circle">Requires importing libraries for state and model management as React doesn&#x27;t implement MVC or provide a complete structure.</li></ul><ul id="b0ea7aff-dddb-4f32-a5c9-59587e7f5276" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:circle">React moves away from class-based modules, which can be challenging for developers accustomed to Object-Oriented Programming.</li></ul></li></ul><ul id="41c9387a-adef-4f07-b805-c1dc59f39dda" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>The Virtual Dom in React - </strong>React.js uses a Virtual DOM to improve web app performance by efficiently managing changes to the actual DOM.
