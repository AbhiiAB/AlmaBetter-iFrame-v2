Backtracking takes this concept even further, allowing you to explore multiple paths to find the optimal solution efficiently.</p><p id="b420237d-c29b-46b8-bb0a-d41d656ebcf2" class=""><em><strong>Duration: </strong></em>8 Hours</p><p id="61c03d8b-abac-4565-80b3-9ffd8258679b" class=""><em><strong>Focus: </strong></em>Recursion &amp; Back Tracking and their time and space complexity analysis</p><p id="94e04a63-979e-4a40-ad08-c82edb27ba63" class=""><em><strong>Pre-requisite: </strong></em>JavaScript</p><h2 id="874895c6-c56a-44b5-88a3-24b7361cc951" class=""><mark class="highlight-red">Theme</mark></h2><p id="0aad366f-570a-40e9-8c33-e68a73b34977" class="">When a user watches a movie on <strong>Netflix</strong> or purchases a product on <strong>Amazon</strong>, the recommendation system needs to quickly and accurately suggest other movies or products that the user might be interested in. This requires analyzing vast amounts of data, including the user&#x27;s viewing or purchase history, as well as other factors like demographics, reviews, and ratings.</p><p id="3721354f-ffc4-4fc9-9cf1-b46a489c4416" class=""><strong>Backtracking</strong> and <strong>recursion</strong> can be used to develop efficient algorithms for generating these recommendations. For instance, a recommendation algorithm may start by suggesting products or movies that are similar to what the user has already viewed or purchased, then recursively generate more suggestions based on the user&#x27;s feedback.</p><p id="60641937-71c5-4773-b09f-30561c47857c" class="">Furthermore, these concepts can be used to optimize the recommendation algorithm by exploring different combinations of factors that may influence the user&#x27;s preferences, such as genre, director, or cast. This process involves backtracking through the options to determine which combination of factors yields the best results.</p><h2 id="c8f2cd76-8d98-4177-ab15-fddf8d5c1a23" class=""><mark class="highlight-red">Primary Goals</mark></h2><ul id="fc4854ff-d26d-4c41-a415-a642dc2ee13a" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Gain comprehension of recursion and backtracking, and their practical applications in problem-solving.</li></ul><ul id="58aa86eb-58b3-4204-a49b-9845d8a96526" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Grasp the trade-offs involved in choosing between recursion and iteration, and discern when each approach is preferable.</li></ul><ul id="0b7e985d-978e-42a6-80b1-799a46a8f800" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Develop the ability to analyze the time and space complexity of recursive and backtracking algorithms.</li></ul><ul id="6dd9758a-d153-4ede-935f-0c482fb87c6b" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Acquire knowledge of the real-world implementation of recursion and backtracking in various applications.</li></ul></div></article></body></html>
