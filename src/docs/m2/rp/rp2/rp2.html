In this paper, a novel fast-searching algorithm based on least square regression curve fitting is introduced to address the challenge of efficient estimation from large datasets.

In such cases, their linear approach could be more efficient and efficient.</p><p id="9ceaef2f-351f-4a80-bac5-57e957816779" class="">To overcome this challenge, the paper introduces a novel fast-searching algorithm based on least square regression curve fitting.

It explains their time complexities in best and worst cases and their prevalence in frameworks, database systems, and various applications. Fast Regression, specifically Least Squares, is mentioned as an extensively studied technique, with algorithms leveraging random projection or subsampling to solve least squares problems efficiently, particularly when the number of features is larger than the number of samples. Interpolation search is discussed as an alternative to binary search, with its time complexity of O(log(log n)). The paper proposes a superior searching technique for sorted datasets, serving as an alternative to binary search and interpolation search.</p><p id="5cbf68eb-3a94-4040-b251-1c7cab993f92" class="">The introduction also emphasizes the importance of linear least-square regression in fields such as biology, cognitive science, technology, and physics. It acknowledges the weakness of least squares in handling poor data, leading to disruptions and anomalies in industrial environments. The need for robust modeling in the face of such disruptions is highlighted, mentioning the least absolute value problem as a method with inherent bad data rejection properties. The paper&#x27;s contribution is introduced as novel techniques for fast searching on sorted datasets, specifically focusing on integer datasets and utilizing curve-based approaches.</p><h3 id="93df24e9-adf8-4a93-8653-d9eaa5cd0f53" class="">Preliminaries:</h3><ol type="1" id="21448ce4-7c5e-492e-a2e1-ae43e8285e22" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li><strong>Curve fitting of a straight line by the least square method </strong><p id="78d213c7-80c9-41ae-acf4-617d358b84be" class="">Curve fitting is a process of finding the best-fit curve for a given set of data points. The least square method is commonly used for fitting a straight line to the data, aiming to minimize the error between the actual data points and the estimated points on the line. By computing the slope and intercept of the line equation, the best-fit line can be determined. In the example provided, the slope and intercept are calculated using the given data set, resulting in an equation for the line. The table demonstrates the difference between the actual values and the estimated values, while a graph showcases the actual line and the estimated straight line obtained through the least square method.</p></li></ol><ol type="1" id="842d139c-ad35-491a-8b15-5d7721abdee1" class="numbered-list" start="2"><li><strong>Correlation</strong><p id="762e703b-0367-49d3-b26f-7caa6f1d3033" class="">Correlation measures the linear relationship between two variables, and the correlation coefficient is a numerical measure of this relationship. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient, denoted as &quot;r,&quot; is a widely used type of correlation coefficient. It ranges between -1 and 1, with values closer to -1 indicating a strong negative correlation, values closer to 1 representing a strong positive correlation, and values close to 0 indicating a weak or no correlation. The correlation between two variables, x, and y, can be calculated using the formula, which takes into account the means and standard deviations of the x and y values.</p></li></ol><h3 id="0095c1c5-6463-46f3-a4cc-fa35b5497202" class="">Proposed Work:</h3><ol type="1" id="2afad295-4444-43d8-ab86-f03902f99b38" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li><strong>Basic idea</strong><p id="84a12399-488e-4c55-9963-21af6d7d298d" class="">The novel fast-searching algorithm presented in the paper leverages the concept of straight-line fitting using the least square method and linear regression. Exploiting the linear trend in sorted datasets, the algorithm fits the data points into a straight line using the least square method, obtaining the equation for the best-fit line. The coefficients of the line are computed based on curve-fitting techniques. The algorithm utilizes this equation to perform searching by substituting the target value and obtaining its possible index.</p><p id="bdc8e26c-a4d7-4484-b061-6438855c4961" class="">Additionally, the proposed algorithm introduces a self-adaptive approach that addresses the limitations of previous methods without requiring feedback or parameter tuning. It implements a high-level F-optimization regression form, where each element undergoes changes with its unique value of F ki. The algorithm combines F optimization and the main optimization process, with the F search occurring over multiple generations while ensuring diversity and a range of F values. This approach allows for efficient searching and optimization on different time scales, enhancing the algorithm&#x27;s performance.</p></li></ol><ol type="1" id="c1462e71-9b41-45a6-ba4b-bf9dc4074264" class="numbered-list" start="2"><li><strong>Algorithm</strong><p id="e140c76d-b7db-4b58-8a6f-382ed6332563" class="">In this section, the paper introduces the primitive searching algorithm that is designed for ideal datasets where the data follows a linear pattern. The algorithm, presented in Algorithm-I, computes the position of the target element in the dataset by comparing it with the value at each position. If a match is found, the algorithm returns the position indicating a successful search. However, the algorithm is limited to datasets that exhibit perfect linearity, where the difference between successive elements is constant, and the correlation between the index and data values is 1.</p><p id="ec4d692f-6ab2-4535-92b5-e3cb49c7fd03" class="">The paper acknowledges that the primitive algorithm may encounter difficulties in handling different abnormalities that can be present in input datasets. These abnormalities include non-linearity, outliers, and zero-slope, which can impact the performance of the algorithm and hinder its ability to perform searches accurately. The limitations of the primitive algorithm pave the way for developing more advanced and robust searching techniques presented in subsequent sections.</p></li></ol><ol type="1" id="05853714-7bff-4b7a-a1bb-7b12c7b917b9" class="numbered-list" start="3"><li><strong>Searching over non-linear data sets</strong><p id="6d5dbd98-779c-4e8c-a793-63b32a17e2b5" class="">To handle non-linear datasets, the algorithm Algorithm-I is enhanced with additional steps. Instead of relying solely on the position obtained from Step-1, the algorithm now increments or decrements the position based on the target value&#x27;s relationship with the value at the current index. This allows for searching in nearby positions, accommodating non-linear patterns in the dataset.</p><p id="2aad803f-4b82-441d-a9d5-4509a9e07acf" class="">For example, if the coefficients of the fitted line are a = 85.29 and b = -182.31, and the target value is 2, the algorithm computes the estimated position as x = ⌊(2 - (-182.31))/85.29⌋ = 2. By comparing the target value with the value at the estimated position, the algorithm either decrements or increments the position until a match is found or the search is concluded. This modification enables effective searching in non-linear datasets.</p></li></ol><ol type="1" id="3d2774b8-683a-4c39-8903-0b92d9629fa7" class="numbered-list" start="4"><li><strong>Dealing with outliers</strong><p id="ddef7c56-1022-4588-9f59-6c70965ce633" class="">In some cases, the input dataset may contain outliers, which are keys with significantly different data values than the rest. When using Step-1 of Algorithm-I to search for outliers, the resulting index may fall outside the valid range. To address this, the algorithm adjusts the search by starting from either end of the dataset. If the computed index is greater than the highest index (n-1), the search begins from the highest index, comparing the target element with the key at each position while decrementing the index until a match is found or the target is greater than the key. Similarly, if the computed index is less than the smallest index (0), the search starts from index 0, incrementing the index and comparing the target with the corresponding key until a match is found or the target is less than the key. This adaptation allows the algorithm to handle outliers effectively, ensuring comprehensive searching in the dataset.’</p></li></ol><ol type="1" id="dcadca37-20ab-4f39-b76e-63e273c003d6" class="numbered-list" start="5"><li><strong>Dealing with zero slope case</strong><p id="d27323fb-067a-4ac9-9f61-14a64e79a706" class="">Algorithm-II is an updated version of Algorithm-I to handle datasets with abnormal conditions. It addresses the scenario where the slope is zero by performing a search for the target element by comparing it with any key in the dataset. If a match is found, the algorithm returns the index indicating a successful search; otherwise, the element is considered not found. This adjustment allows for accurate searching even in cases where all elements form a perfect horizontal line with a zero slope.</p><p id="30d08129-2676-489c-a329-c4f627018916" class="">The proposed rapid search algorithm, Algorithm II, offers efficient and precise solutions for the least square problem. It incorporates the Randomized Hadamard transformation, which enables random sampling and addresses constraints and coordinates in the problem. The algorithm provides optimal values and solution vectors with relatively small approximation errors, outperforming existing exact algorithms. In datasets where the solution size is smaller, and the number of variables is significantly larger, the algorithm achieves relative error approximations in O(log n) time, making it suitable for larger datasets.</p></li></ol><h3 id="7a6f6a90-ceba-4c3a-887e-dac65caebbec" class="">Proposed work discussion on the execution result:</h3><p id="696d2933-9249-40de-9b6d-fd880163db27" class="">The performance of the proposed fast search algorithm is thoroughly evaluated and compared with binary search and interpolation search algorithms.
